Shiny Apps for Comparing Clustering Algorithms (with [Marc Lavielle](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lavielle/))

_Note:_ This repository accompanies our _Journal of Open Research Software_ (JORS) paper, which is under review.

In this repo, we include code for two original Shiny apps for directly comparing two prominent unsupervised machine learning clustering techniques: k-means and Gaussian mixture models (for classification, not prediction, in our case). The goal is to offer researchers and scholars easy-to-use tools for comparing, mapping, and exploring the mechanics of these widely used clustering algorithms. The first app simulates data and the second app uses the Iris data as a sample, and includes both visual and numeric comparisons. 

Please cite the use of our tools in any published work.

Here is a quick demo of each:
